# Rotify: Those who Know 💀
Rotify is the knowledge app you didn’t know you needed—because who wouldn’t want to turn brainpower into memes? Challenge your friends (or total strangers) to trivia duels, climb the global leaderboard, and collect aura points like they’re going out of style. Winners bask in the glow of irony-fueled rewards. Losers? They’ll have to rot on their own time.

## Features ✨  
- **1v1 Trivia Duels**: Flex your knowledge muscles in head-to-head trivia battles. It’s like chess, but without all the pieces (or dignity). 🧠  
- **Meme & Aura Point Prizes**: Win and unlock exclusive memes that only a true trivia overlord could appreciate. Aura points not included in life insurance policies. 🏆  
- **Global Leaderboard**: Because nothing says “I’ve made it” like seeing your name slightly above someone else’s on a list. 🌍  
- **Minimalist Design**: So sleek it’s almost like we forgot to add features. 🎨  
- **Brainrot Fun**: Sharpen your mind while embracing the chaos of knowledge you’ll never need at dinner parties. 🤯
